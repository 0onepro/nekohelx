# **n**.eko
 This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, I made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and my internet can't handle streaming and discord keeps crashing. I just want to watch anime with my friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so I started digging throughout the net and found a few *kinda* clones, but non of them had the virtual browser, then I found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and I was able to figure out the rest. This is by no means a fully featured clone of rabbit, it hs only *one* room. Its stateless, so no saved user names or passwords.

### Why n.eko?
I like cats (Neko is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd

### Why the cat butt?
Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways...
