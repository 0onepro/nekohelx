# **n**.eko
 This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, I made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and my internet can't handle streaming and discord keeps crashing when my friend attempts to. I just want to watch anime with my friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so I started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then I found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and I was able to figure out the rest. This is by no means a fully featured clone of rabbit, it hs only *one* room. It's stateless, so no saved user names or passwords.

### Why **n**.eko?
I like cats 🐱 (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.
