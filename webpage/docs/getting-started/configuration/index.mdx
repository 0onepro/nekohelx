# Configuration

Configuration options can be set using Environment Variables, as an argument to the CLI, or in a configuration file.

Highest priority is given to the Environment Variables, followed by CLI arguments, and then the configuration file.

import Configuration from './configuration.tsx'

<Configuration />
