## How to enable debug mode?

To see verbose information from n.eko server, you can enable debug mode using `NEKO_DEBUG`.

```diff
version: "3.4"
services:
  neko:
    image: "m1k1o/neko:firefox"
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    shm_size: "2gb"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "52000-52100:52000-52100/udp"
    environment:
     NEKO_SCREEN: 1920x1080@30
     NEKO_PASSWORD: neko
     NEKO_PASSWORD_ADMIN: admin
     NEKO_EPR: 52000-52100
     NEKO_ICELITE: 1
+     NEKO_DEBUG: 1
```

Ensure, that you have enabled debug mode in javascript console too, in order to see verbose information from client.

Your iframe needs an attribute: `allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"` or more modern `allow="fullscreen *"`. For the second you can remove the star if your iframe has the same origin or replace it with your iframe origin.
